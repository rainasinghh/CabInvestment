price charged to income ratio per user


cumulative return over time
	

income => split into income buckets and do the following
	which bucket lead to more returns?
	which city has the larger income buckets?
	does higher income => higher return?

number of users vs population: 
	more users => more returns
	might be misleading because of population between 2 cities
	maybe calculate users:population ratio

city => economic differences/long term investment returns

age => distribution of transactions across age

date of travel => do holidays lead to more sales? if so, for which company?

km traveled => higher price charged

gender => who pays more--men or women?
